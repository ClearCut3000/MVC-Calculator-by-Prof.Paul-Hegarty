- history of entering operands and operations in a separate UILabel 
- C button that clears everything on the display 
- backspace button works as Undo 
- added NumberFormatter 
- tuples were used to combine two vars variables (accumulator and its String representations) 
- the ability to enter variables - there are error messages, for example, when dividing by 0 
- taking into account the priority of binary operations when getting a description for a stream of binary operations.
